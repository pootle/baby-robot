# baby-robot
A Collection of the files needed to make a very simple baby robot based on a Raspberry Pi.

I lead a samll group at my local U3A using Raspberry Pi's to play with computers and learn programming.

This is info on a project we have just started to work on a small simple robot.

It is a simple motorised chassis that can be remotely controlled and streams video from an on-board 
camera to a web page. The web page can also control the motors.

It uses various bits of existing software and some extra parts I have written.
